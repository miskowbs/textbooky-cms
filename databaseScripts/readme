This is a readme file for recreating the database for Textbooky. First READ and execute all the files
in createDB.psql. Eventually, I may have an automated script that could be run using
"psql -f <fileToRun> Textbooky", but today is not that day.

After doing all things in createDB.psql, the database is complete, but it will only accept local
connections, so two files must be changed. If you haven't changed any of the default config files, do
"cd /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/" as root. There make sure that the files "pg_hba.conf" and
"postgresql.conf" are the same as the ones in this directory (The lines that begin with a "#" are
comments, so those do not need to be changed if they are different).

In general, the change that needs to be made to "pg_hba.conf" needs the lines

local		all		   postgres	  	  	 	md5
host		all		   all	137.112.0.0/16	md5
host		all		   all	::1/128			ident #Probably is wrong

to be able to interact with all computers on the Rose-Hulman campus.

The change that "postgresql.conf" needs is

change "listen_addresses = 'localhost'" to "listen_addresses = '*'"

Then, run "service postgresql-9.4 restart" as root to apply the changes.

If you made changes but you still cannot connect, try "reboot" as root to restart the server. If
that fails, contact Bart at miskowbs@rose-hulman.edu. Again, if that fails, ask Darryl nicely to help
you, he is a wizard.
